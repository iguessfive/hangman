## How to Play


<p>Guess the word: The game will display a series of blank spaces, 
each representing a letter in a hidden word. You need to guess one letter 
at a time to try and uncover the word. You can do this by clicking on the 
letter on the screen using your mouse<p>

<p>Keep guessing: As you guess letters, the game will show you 
which ones are correct by filling in the blanks where they appear 
in the word. If you guess a letter that is not in the word, the game 
will subtract one of your guesses, and part of a hangman figure will 
start to appear.<p>

<p>Try not to get hanged: The hangman figure will start to take 
shape as you continue to make incorrect guesses. You will lose 
the game if the hangman figure is complete before you guess the word.<p>

<p>Win the game: If you successfully guess the word before the hangman 
figure is complete, you win the game.<p>

<p>Play again: You can keep playing the game as many times as you want.<p>
